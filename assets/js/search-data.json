    "content": "As of the time of this writing (July 2023) three groups have reported tRNA sequencing on Oxford Nanopore platforms: . Thomas et al., ACS Nano (2021) . This paper from the UCSC Nanopore group established proof of principle for direct RNA sequencing of in vitro transcribed and biological E. coli tRNAs on the Oxford MinION platform. The authors defined alignment parameters for nanopore-sequenced tRNAs, and also tested a variety of combinations of individual purified biological tRNAs, synthetic tRNAs, and total tRNAs ligated with individual adapter species. Finally, this paper describes correlations between known sites of modifications on E. coli tRNAs and mismatches (base calling “errors”) at the same and/or neighboring nucleotide positions. The authors note that most sequencing runs were performed for under 24 hours due to “due to a deterioration in functional channels over time,” and that they restarted some experiments up to 5 times due to pore clogging issues. Yields are in the range of 50-100k reads, depending on the sample. White et al., RNA (2023) . This publication from our group applied the approach from Thomas et al. above to perform direct tRNA sequencing of S. cerevisiae tRNA on the Oxford MinION platform. We generated tRNA sequencing libraries from five different yeast strains with alterations in tRNA maturation/processing/degradation pathways. We used these tRNA sequencing data to identify analogous basecalling error signals (primarily mismatches) produced by changes in tRNA modifications when tRNA splicing is disrupted, including 2´-phosphates installed during RNA ligation. An GitHub repository for this work can be found here. NB: despite consultation with Oxford Nanopore and substantial in-lab troubleshooting, in our hands neither changing RNA inputs nor adapter ratios made a substantive impact on either library throughput or the ratio of free adapter to sequencing reads reported in the MinKNOW software during the run. Lucas et al., Nature Biotechnology (2023) . This paper from the Novoa lab elucidated the reason for the perplexing behavior above — the MinKNOW software distinguishes free adapters from RNA reads based primarily on the duration of time a molecule spends transiting the pore. A major contribution of this manuscript is the implementation of a custom configuration for capturing tRNA reads that would otherwise be discarded during sequencing due to their short lengths. As described on the nano-tRNAseq repository, this workflow involves first performing a sequencing run using the MinKNOW default configuration, and saving out a bulk fast5 file. This bulk file is then re-run in a “simulation” mode in MinKNOW using a custom .toml file that contains a) alternative parameters for classifying RNA reads and adapter sequences based duration in the pore and b) a path to the bulk fast5 file. Using this approach, the authors report higher yield MinION runs across S. cerevisiae samples with and without deletions of several tRNA modification enzymes, under either normal growth conditions, heat, or oxidative stress. These comparisons enabled them to further characterize basecalling errors produced by select tRNA modifications. ",

These changes in current over time can be converted to nucleotide sequence, and also used to infer the presence of RNA modifications.

    "content": "tRNAs are highly structured nucleic acids that are decorated with many RNA modifications (an average of 13 RNA modifications per tRNA molecule in budding yeast). A major limitation of previous tRNA sequencing methods was the necessity for reverse transcription to generate cDNA for Illumina sequencing, despite the fact that reverse transcriptases often stall on these molecules. Moreover, the size (70-100 nt) and structure of tRNAs require additional considerations when enriching for these molecules in sequencing libraries. Many tRNA sequencing workflows, including all nanopore tRNA sequencing protocols published to-date, have taken advantage of the unique molecular properties of tRNAs to add specific adapters to these molecules. All mature tRNAs have a 5´ phosphate and an NCCA overhand on their 3´end, to which the amino acid is added. This aminoacyl group will rapidly deacylate under non-acidic conditions, or can be specifically removed with base treatment. In the absence of an amino acid, the mature tRNA stem is then competent for ligation to a double stranded adapter using T4 RNA ligase 2. ",

    "title": "Why use custom sequencing settings for tRNA?",
    "content": "Back when we first started making tRNA sequencing libraries using the approach from Thomas et al. 2021 and running them with default parameters, our runs looked like this: . Note the high proportion of “adapter-only” reads (beige bar) relative to the bright green bar that MinKNOW believes are genuine sequencing reads. Lucas et. al 2023 expertly dissects the reasons behind this issue. In brief, MinKNOW’s default settings expect the adapter portion of reads (or adapter-only reads) to transit through the pore in 5 seconds or less, and expect the remaining portion of the RNA molecule (that is, the thing you’re actually looking to sequence), termed the strand, to take at least 2 seconds to pass through the pore. These default settings from ONT were selected with mRNA sequencing in mind. tRNA molecules are much shorter than mRNA and in many cases, the strand portion of the read can pass through the pore in under two seconds. The Novoa lab demonstrated that lowering the minimum threshold at which MinKNOW classifies the strand portion of read from 2 seconds to 1 second, combined with lowering the maximum duration for adapter signal from 5 seconds to 2 second, increased the throughput of tRNA sequencing by over an order of magnitude, suggesting that the default RNA sequencing parameters classify many tRNA reads as free adapter. TLDR: If you don’t want most of your reads to be inadvertedly discarded, you need to take some extra steps **before you begin sequencing tRNA libraries.** . NB: To the best of my knowledge, MinKNOW senses the break between adapter and strand portions of a read by looking for signal from the RTA adapter; by default, neither this adapter sequence nor the adjoining poly(A) tail will be incorporated into the FASTQ produced during basecalling. In contrast, the sequence from the double stranded adapters ligated to tRNA ends in the first step of nanopore sequencing protocols is basecalled and incorporated into the read sequence stored in the FASTQ files.

    "title": "Enabling short read mode in MinKNOW",
    "content": "RNA short mode setup . We wanted to be able to use a custom MinKNOW configuration for tRNA in real time during sequencing. To do this, we need to make a few changes to the MinKNOW software. MinKNOW’s configuration files live at the following locations: . | In Linux: /opt/ont/minknow/conf/package/ | In MacOS: /Applications/MinKNOW.app/Contents/Resources/conf/package/ | . You will need root permissions to edit and add files in the /package/ folder. We have done this as follows: . | At the bottom of flow_cells.toml, add the following lines: | . # custom configs [FLO-FLG001_short] connector = \"flongle\" [FLO-MIN106_short] connector = \"minion_mk1\" [FLO-PRO002_short] connector = \"promethion\" . | Navigate to the /sequencing/ folder and identify the .toml files for direct RNA sequencing (sequencing_MIN106_RNA.toml for MinION and sequencing_PRO002_RNA.toml for PromethION). Copy the relevant file(s) to create a second version appended _short, e.g.: | . sudo cp sequencing_PRO002_RNA.toml sequencing_PRO002_RNA_short.toml . | Open the new _short version of the RNA.toml file and find the section containing the Read Classification Parameters.

The approach above has been tested for R9.4 Flongle and MinION flow cells running on a MK1B MinION connected to M1 Macbook Pro running MacOS Ventura, and on R9.4 flow cells running on a beta PromethION 24 connected to a desktop running Ubuntu 20.04. Both of these combinations were tested with MinKNOW version 23.04.3. Starting a tRNA sequencing run in short mode . After making the changes above and restarting MinKNOW, FLO-MIN106_short and FLO-PRO002_short will be available as drop down options under Flow Cell Type. Once you select one of these, Direct RNA Sequencing should be the only kit available on the subsequent page. You can set up the rest of the sequencing run in MinKNOW as normal. Do you have versions of these files I can just use instead of editing code by hand? . Yes. You can find them in the companion repository here, but caveat emptor. The MinKNOW software undergoes frequent updates, and using an outdated .toml file may break your ability to run RNA short mode live. At a minimum, you will want to update the [compatibility] section of the .toml to match the MinKNOW core and Bream versions to whatever version of MinKNOW you’re using. You can find these in the MinKNOW UI under Host Settings &gt; Software, and then mousing over the text Installed Version to get a text box on hover. ",
